# Heroes and Villains Craft Demo

Welcome! Intuit has started an exciting new project: a multi-platform Swift app called *HeroesAndVillains*. We hope that this new app will help users everywhere learn more about the shadowy characters who make our imaginary lives ever so much safer (or, in the case of villains, more dangerous) every day!

Our app is just getting started. So far, our app has a simple model and view model so it can ingest data about the world's heroes and villains from a source API, along with some starter views so we can view lists of these characters and see some basic details about them.

Now we need your help to build things out!

Please build and run the app on a simulator of your choice to see how it works so far. Then, please take a look at our [user stories](./UserStories.md), pick a story to get started with, and help us add more heroism to our starter app!
